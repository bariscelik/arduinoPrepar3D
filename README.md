# Arduino & Prepar3D Applications
## Introduction

There are some Prepar3D-Arduino examples in this repo. It contains Windows Form applications, Arduino, Android programs, circuit designs to using with Prepar3D Flight Simulation. The purpose of this study is to create wireless joystick controllers for flight simulator game using basic circuit elements and combining these products in the central unit.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio 2017+
- Some C/C++ and Java knowledge
- Hardware (Arduino, electronic components like Resistor, Capacitor, Potentiometer, Push Button, RF Module)
